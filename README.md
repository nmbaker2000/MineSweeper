# MineSweeper
This is a version of MineSweeper that is in Java. I designed this for my Object-Oriented Programming class during my Freshman year at Coe.

Is it perfect? No. I would love to modify the program to have a leaderboard and also have the real Minesweeper rules. 

Currently, this program will not have it so that your first press will always be a safe space. This, however, wouldn't be a difficult idea to implement.

This was designed and programed during our final few weeks of class, so it was much more advanced than most of our previous code.
